# Django REST API
### Drinks information provider

This app was made to help me learn how to make REST APIs in Django.

It returns drink name, a brief description, and price in a json format.

Utilizes the default Django SQLite3 database to store information.

The API can be used with all CRUD methods. Functionality is preserved when using either url patterns, Django's Admin
panel, using the default REST API html view, or using Postman.
